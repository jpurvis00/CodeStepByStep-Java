/* This class sends a string to a method and returns how many words are in the string.
 * Constraints: Do not use a Scanner to help you solve this problem. Do not use any data 
 * structures such as arrays to help you solve this problem. Do not use the String method 
 * split on this problem. But you can declare as many simple variables like int, char, etc. 
 * as you like. Declaring String variables is also fine.
